## Overview

The GitHub Plugin automates GitHub operations including pull request creation, issue management, and quality validation. It ensures all PRs meet quality standards before submission and follows TDD principles with atomic commits and conventional commit formats.

**Plugin Architecture**: Optimized with progressive disclosure - core workflows (~500 tokens) in SKILL.md files with detailed references in `references/` subdirectories for efficient context loading.

## Plugin Structure

Each skill follows a phase-based workflow structure with detailed reference materials:

```

    ├── SKILL.md                    # Core workflow (~591 tokens)
    └── references/
        ├── requirements.md         # Worktree and TDD workflow
        ├── workflow-details.md     # Detailed process steps
        └── examples.md             # Commit message examples
```

This architecture enables efficient context loading by keeping core workflows concise while providing comprehensive reference materials on demand.

## Commands

### `/github:create-pr`

Creates comprehensive GitHub pull requests with quality validation and gates.

**Metadata:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Allowed Tools | `Task`, `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)` |

**What it does:**
1. Validates repository status and GitHub authentication
2. Analyzes all commits in the branch (full history analysis)
3. Enforces atomic commits: each commit represents one complete, cohesive change
4. Runs comprehensive quality and security checks:
   - Lint validation
   - Test suite execution
   - Build verification
   - Security scanning for sensitive data
5. Validates commit messages follow conventional format:
   - **Format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
   - **Title**: lowercase, <50 chars, imperative mood, optional scope
   - **Body**: ≤72 chars per line, describes what and why
   - **Footer**: References issues with auto-closing keywords
6. Ensures all checks pass before PR creation
7. Creates comprehensive PR description with:
   - Summary of changes (1-3 bullet points)
   - Test plan checklist
   - Related issues and PRs
   - Quality validation status
8. Applies automated labels based on changes
9. Creates PR using GitHub CLI with proper metadata

**Usage:**
```bash
/github:create-pr
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make atomic commits following conventional format
/git:commit  # First feature commit
/git:commit  # Second feature commit

# Create PR with quality gates
/github:create-pr

# Claude will:
# - Validate all commits follow conventional format
# - Run lint, test, build, security checks
# - Ensure all quality gates pass
# - Generate comprehensive PR description
# - Apply labels and link issues
# - Create PR and provide URL
```

**Features:**
- **Quality gates**: All checks must pass before PR creation
- **Atomic commits**: Validates each commit is a logical unit
- **Conventional commits**: Enforces commit message standards
- **Comprehensive validation**: Lint, test, build, security
- **Auto-labeling**: Applies labels based on change types
- **Issue linking**: Automatically links related issues
- **Security scanning**: Checks for sensitive data exposure
- **Failure resolution**: Uses specialized agents to fix issues

**Failure resolution process:**
When quality checks fail, the command:
1. Uses TodoWrite to create specific task lists
2. Invokes specialized agents for fixes:
   - **@code-reviewer** for logic and correctness
   - **@security-reviewer** for security issues
3. Fixes issues systematically with validation
4. Re-runs checks until all pass

### `/github:create-issues`

Creates GitHub issues following TDD principles with proper labels, scope, and auto-closing keywords.

**Metadata:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Allowed Tools | `Task`, `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)` |
| Argument Hint | `[description]` |

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes repository context and existing issues
2. Determines issue type (epic, PR-scoped, or review issue)
3. Creates proper labels if they don't exist:
   - `priority:high` - High priority - this sprint
   - `priority:medium` - Medium priority - next sprint
   - `priority:low` - Low priority - backlog
4. Creates issues with required structure:
   - Title (≤70 chars, imperative, no emojis)
   - Proper labels
   - Detailed body with problem description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Context and links
5. Applies auto-closing keywords for PR-scoped issues
6. Provides issue URLs and tracking information

**Usage:**
```bash
/github:create-issues [\"Bug description\" \"Feature description\"]
```

**Example workflows:**
```bash
# Create single issue
/github:create-issues \"Fix memory leak in auth service\"

# Create multiple issues
/github:create-issues \"Add rate limiting\" \"Update payment API\" \"Fix mobile layout\"

# With detailed description (interactive)
/github:create-issues
# Claude will ask for details and create properly formatted issue
```

**Features:**
- **TDD-first**: Follows test-driven development workflow
- **Branch-aware**: Decision tree based on current branch
- **Proper labeling**: Automatic label assignment
- **Scope determination**: Epic vs PR-scoped issues
- **Auto-closing**: Uses keywords (Closes, Fixes, Resolves)
- **Structured format**: Consistent issue templates

**Branch-based decision logic:**
- **On main/develop**: Create issue directly
- **On PR branch**: Ask "Must this be fixed before merge?"
  - **Yes**: Comment in PR with detailed context
  - **No**: Create new issue for later with justification

**Issue types:**
1. **Epic issues**: Multi-PR initiatives (no auto-close keywords)
2. **PR-scoped issues**: Single PR resolution (use auto-close keywords)
3. **Review issues**: Non-blocking feedback from PR reviews

### `/github:resolve-issues`

Resolves GitHub issues using isolated worktrees and TDD workflow with comprehensive quality validation.

**Metadata:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Allowed Tools | `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(cd:*)`, `Bash(mkdir:*)`, `Task` |

**What it does:**
1. **Issue Selection**: Evaluates open issues and prioritizes next actionable item
2. **Worktree Setup**: Creates or reuses isolated worktree with descriptive branch name
3. **TDD Implementation**:
   - Plan with **@tech-lead-reviewer** for architectural impact

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed
- GitHub CLI must be authenticated: `gh auth login`
- Repository must have a GitHub remote named `origin`
- Project must have configured lint, test, and build commands
- Git version 2.5+ for worktree support

## Troubleshooting

### `/github:create-pr` fails quality checks

**Issue**: Lint, test, build, or security checks fail

**Solution**:
- Review failure output carefully
- Fix all issues systematically
- For security issues, work with @security-reviewer
- Re-run `/github:create-pr` after all fixes
- Consider splitting large PRs if too many issues

### GitHub CLI not authenticated

**Issue**: `gh` commands fail with authentication error

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Select appropriate authentication method
- Verify with: `gh auth status`
- Ensure repository remote: `git remote -v`

### PR description is incomplete

**Issue**: PR description missing context or details

**Solution**:
- Ensure commits follow conventional format
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues in commit messages
- Manually edit PR after creation if needed
- Check full commit history for context

### Worktree operations fail

**Issue**: `git worktree` commands fail

**Solution**:
- Update Git to version 2.5+
- Check worktree list: `git worktree list`
- Remove orphaned worktrees: `git worktree remove <path>`
- Clean up with: `git worktree prune`
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Issue auto-closing doesn't work

**Issue**: Merged PR doesn't close linked issues

**Solution**:
- Use correct keywords: Closes, Fixes, Resolves
- Reference issue in PR or commit message
- Check GitHub repository permissions
- Verify issue exists and is open
- Manually close if needed and update process

## Safety Features
