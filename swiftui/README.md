## Overview

The SwiftUI Plugin provides comprehensive code review for SwiftUI applications, ensuring adherence to modern Swift development standards and best practices. This plugin is based on the work of Paul Hudson (twostraws) and is continuously updated for the latest SwiftUI APIs.

## Commands

### `/swiftui-review`

Comprehensive SwiftUI code review skill for best practices on modern APIs, maintainability, and performance.

**When triggered:**
- User requests SwiftUI code review
- Reading, writing, or reviewing SwiftUI projects
- Checking for deprecated API usage
- Validating accessibility compliance

**Review process:**
1. Check for deprecated API using `references/api.md`
2. Check that views, modifiers, and animations are optimal via `references/views.md`
3. Validate data flow configuration using `references/data.md`
4. Ensure navigation is updated and performant via `references/navigation.md`
5. Verify design follows Apple HIG via `references/design.md`
6. Validate accessibility compliance via `references/accessibility.md`
7. Ensure efficient code execution via `references/performance.md`
8. Quick Swift code validation via `references/swift.md`
9. Final code hygiene check via `references/hygiene.md`

**Output format:**
```
