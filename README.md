## Plugin Structure

Each plugin follows Claude Code's standard plugin structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata (required)
├── commands/                # Slash commands (optional, legacy)
│   └── command-name.md
├── agents/                  # Agent definitions (optional)
│   └── agent-name.md
├── skills/                  # Skill definitions (optional)
│   └── skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md         # Main skill file
│       └── references/      # Detailed reference materials
├── hooks/                   # Hook configurations (optional)
│   └── hooks.json
├── scripts/                 # Utility scripts (optional)
└── README.md                # Plugin documentation (optional)
```

### Skills vs Commands Architecture

Modern plugins use **skills-based architecture** where each skill is a directory containing:
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill file with YAML frontmatter
- `references/` - Detailed reference materials for progressive disclosure

**Skills registered as commands in plugin.json:**
```json
{
  "commands": [
    "./skills/skill-name/"
  ]
}
```
